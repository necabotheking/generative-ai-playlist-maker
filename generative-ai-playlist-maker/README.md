## Summary
This project, "INFINIâˆžTRACKS," is the final project for the University of Chicago's MPCS 57200: Generative AI Course for the Winter 2024 Quarter. The project aims to create an AI-generated playlist recommender system using the Spotify Web API. It prompts the user to log in with Spotify and choose to generate a playlist based on their top tracks, top artists, or choose a surprise genre.


Next Steps: I hope to integrate fine-tuning through user collected feedback on the songs generated to create a better playlist. Additionally, I plan to add functionality for user's to be able to save the generated playlist.
